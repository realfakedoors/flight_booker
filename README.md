This is a flight booking application, written in Rails for The Odin Project:

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of advanced implementations of forms in rails.

Visitors can search available flights based on their desired date and airport, select an appropriate flight, and register their passenger information. Typically the final step in this process would be inputting payment information through a service like Paypal, which can be easily implemented with an SDK/gem or Stripe.
